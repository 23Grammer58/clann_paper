\section{Introduction}

We introduce CLANN (Convex Laplace Artificial Neural Network), a data-driven hyperelastic constitutive model for nonlinear continuum mechanics. CLANN is built on three principles: (i) hyperelasticity, where stresses are derived from a scalar stored-energy potential \(\psi\); (ii) strict convexity, which guarantees uniqueness, stability, and positive-definite tangent moduli; and (iii) frame invariance, achieved by defining \(\psi\) in terms of the right Cauchy--Green tensor \(C=F^{\top}F\). We parameterize \(C\) through its upper Cholesky factor and use logarithmic coordinates, which enable an input convex neural network (ICNN) to represent a strictly convex energy. Second Piola--Kirchhoff stresses and the consistent tangent are obtained by analytic differentiation via the chain rule, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and efficient finite element (FE) integration. The model handles large strains robustly and reduces to linear elasticity in the small-strain limit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Kinematics and Parameterization}
Let \(F\) denote the deformation gradient and \(C=F^{\top}F\) the right Cauchy--Green tensor. We use the upper-triangular Cholesky factor \(U\) such that \(C=U^{\top}U\). In 2D, introduce logarithmic coordinates
\begin{equation}
\xi_1=\ln(u_{11}),\quad \xi_2=\ln(u_{22}),\quad \xi_3=\frac{u_{12}}{u_{11}},
\end{equation}
which improve conditioning at large strains and support convex modeling in \(\xi\).

\subsection{Convex Neural Energy}
An input convex neural network defines a strictly convex energy \(\psi(\xi)\):
\begin{equation}
z=\frac{\operatorname{softplus}(\beta W_1\xi)}{\beta},\qquad \psi=W_2^{\top}z+b_2,
\end{equation}
with nonnegative output weights \(W_2\ge 0\) to preserve convexity. As a consequence, the Hessian \(H=\partial^2\psi/\partial\xi^2\) is positive definite.

\subsection{Stresses and Consistent Tangent}
Hyperelastic stresses follow from the chain rule:
\begin{equation}
S=\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial C}=\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial \xi}\,\frac{\partial\xi}{\partial C},\qquad g=\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\xi}.
\end{equation}
In 2D the components admit explicit expressions
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
S_{11}&=e^{-2\xi_1}(g_1-2\xi_3 g_3)+e^{-2\xi_2}g_2\,\xi_3^2,\\
S_{22}&=e^{-2\xi_2}g_2,\\
S_{12}&=-e^{-2\xi_2}g_2\,\xi_3+e^{-2\xi_1}g_3.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The analytic Hessian used in Newton's method is
\begin{equation}
H_{ij}=\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\xi_i\,\partial\xi_j}=\sum_h \sigma'_h\,w_{2,h}\,W_{h,i}W_{h,j},\quad \sigma'=\beta\,\sigma(1-\sigma),\ \sigma=\operatorname{sigmoid}(\beta s),\ s=W_1\xi+b_1.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Training Objective}
Given stress data \(S^{(i)}_{\text{exp}}\), the loss combines data misfit and anchors at the undeformed state:
\begin{equation}
L=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\lVert S^{(i)}_{\text{pred}}-S^{(i)}_{\text{exp}}\rVert^2+\lambda_{SI}\,\lVert S(I)\rVert^2+\lambda_{d\psi}\,\lVert\nabla_{\xi}\psi(0)\rVert^2+\lambda_{\psi}\,\lVert\psi(0)\rVert^2.
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

We report theoretical properties and implementation outcomes. First, strict convexity of \(\psi\) implies positive-definite tangent moduli, which enhances robustness of Newton iterations. Second, the chain-rule construction ensures objective and conservative stresses, i.e., for any closed deformation cycle the stress work vanishes. Third, the logarithmic parameterization provides symmetric behavior under tension/compression and robust handling of large strains. In the small-strain regime, CLANN reduces to linear elasticity with Lam\'e parameters emerging from the local quadratic approximation of \(\psi\).

\subsection{Thermodynamic Consistency}
Because stresses derive from an energy potential, CLANN satisfies the first law in the hyperelastic setting (no dissipation) and meets the second-law requirements for quasi-static, reversible processes. Anchors enforce \(\psi(0)=0\) and \(S(I)=0\), making the undeformed configuration an energy minimum with zero stress and vanishing gradient in \(\xi\).

\subsection{Numerical Aspects}
The analytic Hessian enables consistent tangents for FE assembly and improves convergence of Newton's method. For deployment, automatic differentiation can compute \(g=\partial\psi/\partial\xi\), while closed-form expressions supply \(S\) and the tangent via \(\partial\xi/\partial C\). The model can be exported to inference formats by wrapping gradient and Hessian evaluations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}

CLANN unifies classical hyperelastic modeling with modern convex neural networks. Compared to traditional forms (Neo-Hookean, Mooney--Rivlin, Ogden), CLANN maintains the fundamental relationship \(S=\partial\psi/\partial C\) while learning \(\psi\) from data under strict convexity constraints. This yields improved stability and expressiveness, and it facilitates incorporation of priors such as near-incompressibility or anisotropy via extensions of the parameterization and network architecture. The convex design reduces non-physical responses and mitigates bifurcations in challenging loading paths.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}

We introduced a mathematically grounded, thermodynamically consistent neural constitutive model for hyperelasticity. A Cholesky-based logarithmic parameterization and an ICNN energy ensure strict convexity, objective stresses, and positive-definite tangents. Explicit stress and Hessian formulas support efficient FE integration and robust Newton convergence. The framework recovers linear elasticity at small strains and is well-suited to soft-tissue biomechanics; future work will address anisotropy and near-incompressibility.
